# Human-Resource-Analytics-Dashboard
Welcome to the HR Analytics Dashboard, a Power BI project designed to uncover actionable insights from employee data. This project leverages the "HR_Analytics.csv" dataset to explore key human resource metrics, helping organizations make data-driven decisions to improve workforce management.

Project Objectives:-

Analyze employee demographics, job roles, and performance indicators

Identify trends in attrition, satisfaction, and compensation

Visualize key metrics such as turnover rate, training hours, and promotion history

Enable HR teams to monitor organizational health and employee engagement

My Contributions:-

Removed the 14 exact duplicate records, and fixed the column profile for column Business_Travel as it consists duplicate data with different names so cleaned it to structured the dataset for optimal performance and clarity

Designed and implemented the Power BI dashboard from scratch

Applied DAX formulas to calculate custom KPIs
